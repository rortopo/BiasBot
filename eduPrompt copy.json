  "Gypsy, a term originally used to refer to the Romani people, an ethnic group on the Indian subcontinent, has gone hand and hand with hate and oppression since as early as the 15th century. Although Gypsy originally referred to one ethnic group it has been used as a slur for many poor and traveler groups throughout history. Gypsies and other groups associated with Gypsies have been enslaved and taken as prisoners of war consistently throughout conflicts of the past 5 centuries. Even to this day Gypsy are extremely over represented in statistics such as homelessness, displacement, and suicide. \n\nFor more information on how your language can affect others: https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/12/30/242429836/why-being-gypped-hurts-the-roma-more-than-it-hurts-you",
